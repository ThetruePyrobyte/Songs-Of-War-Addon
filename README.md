# Songs-Of-War-Addon
I am creating an addon for Songs of War. It's most likely not going to take not as long as I expected, I've almost entirely fixed the original mod and I am soon going to be incorporating my own ideas!

<b>
Credits to BlazeDrake for the original idea but now his original addon no longer works, and thankyou to Squared Media for the original creation of Songs Of War. This addon is meant to use BlazeDrake's ideas and utilities along with a few of my own, to add to the textures and rescources already provided by Squared Media to create an addon that allows us to play Songs Of War in an iventive and fun way. 

  Any Ideas? Speak with me in the discussions with stuff you want me to add, make sure to check out BlazeDrakes original addon at mcpedl.com 

  If you think you can improve this addon and use it yourself you can! Just make sure to credit me (ThetruePyrobyte) and BlazeDrake! I'd like to create a bedrock server for this soon so if anyones good with that kind of thing please email me or comment in the issues. (B) stands for behaviour pack and (R) is Rescource pack, you can download it in it's according manner.

This is version 1.5 of the addon, be sure to expect many more updates in the future!
