# Songs-Of-War-Addon
I am creating an addon for Songs of War. It's most likely going to take a very long time so I hope your in for the wait.

<b>
Credits to BlazeDrake for the original idea but now his original addon no longer works, and thankyou to Squared Media for the original creation of Songs Of War. This addon is meant to use BlazeDrake's ideas and utilities along with a few of my own, to add to the textures and rescources already provided by Squared Media to create an addon that allows us to play Songs Of War in an iventive and fun way. 

  Any Ideas? Add issues with stuff you want me to add, make sure to check out BlazeDrakes original addon at mcpedl.com
